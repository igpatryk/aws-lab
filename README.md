# aws-lab
AWS Free Tier lab - IaC, CI/CD, ECS apps, infra&amp;apps monitoring<br />
TBD ðŸ˜Ž
## Game plan:
1. Create a basic API using Python (backend app).
2. Create a basic frontend web UI that will call the API created in point 1 (S3 bucket configured as a Static Website).
3. Set up AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
4. Use GitLab CI/CD to deploy both backend and frontend apps to Amazon ECS on EC2.
5. Set up infra and apps monitoring (Zabbix? PagerDuty? Nagios? I don't know yet ðŸ˜œ).
6. ELK stack? TIG stack? Ansible/Chef/Puppet? Selenium/SoapUI? SonarQube? Jenkins (as an alternative to GitLab CI/CD)? **Sky is the limit!** ðŸ˜‰
